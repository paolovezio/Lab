Python interfaces of a DDS AD9959 by using a serial port RS232.
In the interface is possible reading the serial ports and using the program for many DDS simultaneusly. 
In the program it is possible to select the boud rate between 2 values.
It is possible to select also:
  - Clock: internal or external
  - Frequency of the external clock (f_ext) and only one value of the multiplier Kp = 20, 
    this means that the real clock frequency is f_ext * Kp.
  - Frequency, Amplitude, Phase of 4 channels
  - It is possible to Sending, Save, reset, CLK the channels setting,
  -
